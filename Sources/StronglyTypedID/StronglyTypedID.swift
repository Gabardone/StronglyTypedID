/**
 A protocol for easy declaration of strongly typed ID types based on typical primitive values.

 The protocol groups all the expected ease of dev use behaviors so the ID can be used as dictionary keys,
 encoded/decoded, and logged or reported out as just its raw value.

 The protocol has been tested work with `RawValue` as a `String`, `URL`, `UUID`, and integer types. Floating point
 types should work as long as encoding/decoding doesn't lose precision (it's probably not a good idea to use them for
 anything that isn't strictly local).

/**
 A macro that declares a strongly typed ID.

 - Parameters
   - name: The name of the new ID type. Must be a valid type identifier at compile time.
   - backing: The type that backs the ID type, its `rawValue`
   - adopts: Optionally, a comma separated list of protocols that the ID type also adopts. Currently Swift doesn't allow
 for a declaration that would check that the parameters sent are as described, but the expanded macro will fail to build
 if any of the parameters isn't a protocol.
